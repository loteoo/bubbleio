  Hyperapp 2.0 boilerplate
</h1>

Ready-to-go Hyperapp PWA/SPA starter template  


## ðŸš€ Quick start: 
```
# Clone project
git clone https://github.com/loteoo/hyperapp-boilerplate.git

cd hyperapp-boilerplate

npm install     # Install dependencies
npm start       # Dev server + live reload
```

```
npm run build   # Build for production and generate service worker
```
Or use a [.zip download](https://github.com/loteoo/hyperapp-boilerplate/archive/master.zip)

 
## Overview
- Uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for compilation, dev server and hot module reloading.  (It's  blazing fast, easy to use and reliable)
- [Hygen](https://www.hygen.io/) code generators are included for common use cases. (More to come!)  
- Works offline out of the box using [workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) to generate service workers and precache application files
- PWA/SPA ready with a default web app manifest
- Sane CSS defaults and reset with [sanitize.css](https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/)
- Uses the [standard](https://standardjs.com/) JavaScript style guide  
- [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and the latest ES6-7-8-9 syntax is ready to use thanks to Parcel  


## File structure
Proposed folder structure as your project grows. Adapt it to your needs.

## Code generators
(TODO: use enquirer to ask questions and generate the corresponding component)
Generate new Hyperapp components like this:
```
hygen component new --name 'component name'
hygen page new --name 'page name'
```
Available generators are located in the _templates folder. Feel free to add some more or change the existing ones!

### Hyperapp 2.0 TLDR:

- **State**: Runtime data of your app, usually a javascript object.  
- **View**: Pure function that maps the State of your app to a DOM representation of the app (called virtual DOM). The vDOM will get rendered efficiently to the browser by hyperapp.  
- **Actions**: Pure functions that receives the current State, some params, and returns the next State.  
- **Subscribtions**: Declarative wrappers around event listeners. They are aware of the State and can dispatch Actions.  
- **Effects**: Declarative wrappers around side effects to interact with the outside world.  

Basically, use functional programming to describe an application and let Hyperapp bring it to life!

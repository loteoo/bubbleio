main.action() or actions.action from inside component


actions as function with return true and state.something = value instead of object return
for example, i want to update the state of a deep (ex 3 levels down in the json) object, how do i do that



Do actions re-render the whole app and should i minimize rendered elements?
for example, if im building a socket.io app that updates the state multiple times per seconds,
is the whole app going to re-render every time?


Should i pass state and actions to components or should i use the globally availables Components
